# javascript: the more you know, the less you code

## a different semantic markup
we're always talking about the benefits of semantic markup

`accessibility`, `cleaner code`, `future proof`. . .

what about **semantic markup** from the _developer point of view_

writing **markup** than means something to us

while rethinking what an email template is

with `plain javascript`


## test before you test
**nothing** compares to testing in real email clients

litmus previews are amazing

virtual device labs are amazing

i wanted a way to **test before i test**

**early** in the process

to _mimic the quirks_ of certain email clients, in the browser

to do that, i built a chrome extension

with `plain javascript`
